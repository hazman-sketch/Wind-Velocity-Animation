# Wind-Velocity-Animation
When I saw Mr. Qiusheng Wu's post on LinkedIn about creating a global wind velocity animation, I am interested for doing the same. But I apply it with my own data. Luckily he include his notebook on his post. I finish it! My visualization is the condition of wind velocity and direction in the east monsoon (June, July, August). Location in Indonesia.
